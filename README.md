# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which is widely used for binary classification practice. The goal is to understand the data through visualization and statistical analysis to identify important factors that might influence survival.

## 📌 Objectives

* Understand the structure and content of the Titanic dataset.
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Explore data visually to find trends and patterns.
* Derive initial insights that might help build predictive models.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python 🐍
* Google Colab Notebook 📓
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## 📊 Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Loading the dataset**
2. **Checking for missing values and handling them**
3. **Univariate and bivariate analysis**
4. **Visualization of key features (like age, class, gender)**
5. **Correlation analysis**
6. **Insights and takeaways**

## 📈 Sample Insights

* Women had a higher survival rate than men.
* First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in third class.
* Younger passengers had slightly higher chances of survival.

✅ Conclusion
This Titanic EDA project provides valuable insights into the factors affecting passenger survival. By analyzing key variables such as gender, passenger class, age, and embarkation point, we observed clear patterns that help explain survival outcomes:

Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive, suggesting socioeconomic status played a role.

Younger passengers, especially children, had a better chance of survival.

Missing values in the dataset (particularly in "Age" and "Cabin") required attention and handling to avoid skewed analysis.
